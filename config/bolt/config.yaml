# If you want to brand the Bolt backend for a client, you can change some key
# variables here, that determine the name of the backend, and adds a primary
# support/contact link to the footer.  Add a scheme, like `mailto:` or
# `https://` to the email or URL.
#
# Additionally you can change the mount point for the backend, either for
# convenience or to obscure it from prying eyes.
#
# The Bolt backend is accessible as `/bolt/` by default. If you change it here,
